# Visual Studio Monokai Pro Fonts and Colors

Inspired by [Monokai Pro](https://monokai.pro/)

Fonts and Colors settings file for using Monokai Pro colors in Visual Studio 2017+ (VB and C#, SQL Highlighting should be similar to Monokai Pro as well)  
1. Install the [Enhanced Syntax Highlighting](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=StanislavKuzmichArtStea1th.EnhancedSyntaxHighlighting) extension
2. In Visual Studio navigate to Import settings. Import MonokaiPro-VB-C#.vssettings

Differences  
Parameters remain highlighted orange throughout methods, not just in method headers. This seems to be a limitation of Visual Studio syntax highlighting.
